DX-Ball
------------------
This is a simple DX-Ball game made using C and C++ for my 1-1 term CSE 102 project. There are two game modes (i) Normal and (ii) Endless. There are 3 levels in normal mode. In endless mode new bricks will keep spawning
a after current brick count is less than a a certain amount. Top 10 high scores from each level are shown in leaderborad. There is also the option of choosing game music from 3 available ones.
